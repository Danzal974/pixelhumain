Inline vs non inline
===
	To be displayed in some email reader, the css couldn't be store in the <head> but the css class should be inline.
	We use a tool of mailchimp to transform a classic css/html in a inline css/html : http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/
	We store in noninline the template before transformation. It's easier to modify the classic css/html than the inline version
	Note : Watch out with the php code that will be replaced by html special characters
